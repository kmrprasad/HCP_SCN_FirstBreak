# HCP_SCN_FirstBreak
Sample code for analysis detailed in "Modular Architecture and resilience of structural covariance networks in first-episode antipsychotic naive psychoses" 
Published in Nature's Scientific Reports Open Access Article Link: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-34210-y

Step by step code is detailed in FirstBreak_HCP_SCN_Analysis.m 
Dependencies are in house codes written by CONCEPT Lab members 
Code also relies on Brain Connectivity Toolbox https://sites.google.com/site/bctnet/
In article we have six groups but these codes only show two groups for simplicity and clarity.

Contact first author Madison Lewis (mtl47@pitt.edu) if there are any questions or to request sample data from morphometric measures of parcellations.
