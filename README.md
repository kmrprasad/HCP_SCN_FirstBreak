PLEASE CITE THE FOLLOWING PAPER WHEN YOU USE/MODIFY THIS CODE:

Lewis, M., Santini, T., Theis, N. et al. Modular architecture and resilience of structural covariance networks in first-episode antipsychotic-naive psychoses. Sci Rep 13, 7751 (2023). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-34210-y

Step by step code is detailed in FirstBreak_HCP_SCN_Analysis.m 
Dependencies are in house codes written by CONCEPT Lab members 
Code also relies on Brain Connectivity Toolbox https://sites.google.com/site/bctnet/
In article we have six groups but these codes only show two groups for simplicity and clarity.
